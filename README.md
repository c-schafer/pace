Pace is an iOS application that serves as an alternative to iPhone users prone to doom scrolling on social media apps. With Pace’s customizable app icon, it can serve as an easy-to-click placeholder for applications such as: Instagram & TikTok. 

Pace’s interface functions by providing short informational blurbs about various topics presented in an easy-to-read, scrollable format. Pace’s algorithm will suggest content based on the user’s interests that they indicated within their profile set-up process. Pace’s algorithm will then continue to learn their interests based on the user’s history of what they read and for how long.

Users needing customer support within the app can reach out to software developer Carter Schafer. Pace’s software and design is maintained by Carter Schafer and content development is maintained by product manager Coleen Connaughton.
